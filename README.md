# Meme Messenger

Sign up your number to get programming memes sent to you daily. Memes are sent at noon (MST) everyday:

*Currently Meme Messenger only sends memes to 10 phone numbers daily (Twilio costs money, I'm on a budget!), therefore the oldest phone number is removed when an 11th number is added. 

## Languages:
- Python 3.7
- HTML
- CSS

## Technologies:
- Django
- SQLite
- Bootstrap
- Twilio API
- Imgur API
